# PythonSearchSQLServer
A python search for SQL based database with user defined variables

This code prompts the user for the field and value to search for, and then constructs an SQL query to search the database for records where the specified field equals the specified value. The results of the query are then fetched and printed.

Note that this is just a basic example, and you may need to modify the code depending on the specifics of your database and the requirements of your application.
